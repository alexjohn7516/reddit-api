# Reddit Data Visualization

# How I am working on this project
My goal is to build a data heatmap using subreddit data from the Reddit REST API. The heatmap will show the activity of each subreddit based on time. You will be able to search any subreddit of your liking.

* The use of a [Software Development Lifecycle](./SDLC.md) is probably unnessary for this small project but it is a good technique to learn.
* I built the designs, UI/UX, and workflow of the app using Figma and github: [Project Designs PDF]().
* I used 2 long lasting branches and a variety short lived (feature) branches that merge into the Development branch, and the development branch is merged into the production branch. I approahed this project with this workflow to simulate a professional workflow with a team.
* Every PR is simulated with a [Template](.github/pull_request_template.md) to encorporate clear communication with every merge.
* The Reddit API is open to the public as long as you have an authorization key, and I was interested in what data lies within it.
* The project is build with Next.JS, TypeScript, Express, Node.js. I used Next.js because I was familiar with React and learned good things about it. I wanted to learn it and see how it works in comparison with React.
